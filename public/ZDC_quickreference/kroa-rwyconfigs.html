<h3>ROANOKE RUNWAY CONFIGURATIONS</h3>

Runway configuration at Roanoke is completely at Local Control's discretion.  Guidelines are:
<ul>
<li>Runway 34 may not be used for IFR departures.</li>
<li>Choose the two runways most closely aligned with the wind.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, aligning arrivals with wind takes priority over aligning departures with wind, the above restriction notwithstanding.</li>
<li>Wind permitting, align such that neither departures nor arrivals need to taxi across a runway (example: arrive 16, depart 24).</li>
<li>If wind is greater than fifteen knots and closely aligned with one runway, single-runway ops may be employed.</li>
</ul>
